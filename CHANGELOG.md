# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 0.6.2 (2026-05-08)

### Connection Management
- **[Feature]** Add class-level configuration for extending reconnectable error detection. `PGMQ::Connection.reconnectable_error_patterns` accepts additional `String` or `Regexp` patterns (strings matched as case-insensitive substrings; regexps against the original message). `PGMQ::Connection.reconnectable_error_classes` accepts additional `Exception` subclasses. This allows users to adapt to new pg gem / PostgreSQL / pooler disconnect signatures without waiting for a gem release.
- **[Fix]** `PGMQ::Connection#connection_lost_error?` now detects SSL-layer teardown errors (`"PQconsumeInput() SSL error: unexpected eof while reading"`, `"SSL SYSCALL error: EOF detected"`). Observed in production behind a managed Postgres pooler: an idle connection torn down at the SSL layer caused the next enqueue to raise `PGMQ::Errors::ConnectionError` without triggering `with_connection`'s single-retry path, because the message didn't match any of the existing substrings.
- **[Fix]** `PGMQ::Connection#connection_lost_error?` now also matches by class (`PG::ConnectionBad`, `PG::UnableToSend`) in addition to message substrings. These are dedicated connection-failure classes libpq raises when the socket is dead; class-matching catches future OS/pooler/TLS message variants without waiting for them to hit production.

## 0.6.1 (2026-04-16)

### Connection Management
- **[Fix]** `PGMQ::Connection#verify_connection!` now also resets connections whose status is `PG::CONNECTION_BAD`. Previously it only checked `conn.finished?`, which misses connections closed server-side by the database or an intermediate pooler (PgBouncer `server_idle_timeout` / `client_idle_timeout`, admin kill, TCP RST). A pooled connection with a dead socket would survive `verify_connection!` and fail on the next operation with `PQsocket() can't get socket descriptor`.
- **[Fix]** `PGMQ::Connection#connection_lost_error?` now recognises `"PQsocket() can't get socket descriptor"` (plus `"connection is closed"` / `"connection has been closed"`). This is the exact error the `pg` gem raises from its C extension when the cached libpq socket FD is gone. Without the match, the `auto_reconnect` retry path in `with_connection` skipped this error and producers failed on the first call following a server-side close.

## 0.6.0 (2026-04-02)

### Breaking Changes
- **[Breaking]** Drop Ruby 3.2 support. Minimum required Ruby version is now 3.3.0.

### Connection Management
- **[Breaking]** Detect shared `PG::Connection` across pool slots at creation time. When a callable connection factory returns the same `PG::Connection` object to multiple pool slots, concurrent threads corrupt libpq's internal state, causing nil `PG::Result` (`NoMethodError: undefined method 'ntuples' for nil`), segfaults, or wrong data. The pool now tracks connection identity via `ObjectSpace::WeakKeyMap` and raises `PGMQ::Errors::ConfigurationError` immediately with a descriptive error message. WeakKeyMap entries are automatically cleaned up when connections are GC'd. **This change is breaking for configurations that intentionally share a single `PG::Connection` across multiple pool slots. Users must ensure their callable returns a distinct `PG::Connection` per pool slot or configure `pool_size: 1` when reusing a single shared connection.**

### Infrastructure
- **[Change]** Migrate test framework from RSpec to Minitest/Spec with Mocha for mocking, aligning with the broader Karafka ecosystem conventions.
- **[Change]** Replace `rubocop-rspec` with `rubocop-minitest` for test linting.
- **[Change]** Add `bin/integrations` runner script that centralizes integration spec execution. Specs no longer need `require_relative "support/example_helper"` — the runner injects it via `-r` flag. Run all specs with `bin/integrations` or specific ones with `bin/integrations spec/integration/foo_spec.rb`.

## 0.5.0 (2026-02-24)

### Breaking Changes
- **[Breaking]** Remove `detach_archive(queue_name)` method. PGMQ 2.0 no longer requires archive table detachment as archive tables are no longer member objects. The server-side function was already a no-op in PGMQ 2.0+.
- **[Breaking]** Rename `vt_offset:` parameter to `vt:` in `set_vt`, `set_vt_batch`, and `set_vt_multi` methods. The `vt:` parameter now accepts either an integer offset (seconds from now) or an absolute `Time` object for PGMQ v1.11.0+.

### PGMQ v1.11.0 Features
- **[Feature]** Add `last_read_at` field to `PGMQ::Message`. Returns the timestamp of the last read operation for the message, or nil if the message has never been read. This enables tracking when messages were last accessed (PGMQ v1.8.1+).
- **[Feature]** Add Grouped Round-Robin reading for fair message processing:
  - `read_grouped_rr(queue_name, vt:, qty:)` - Read messages in round-robin order across groups
  - `read_grouped_rr_with_poll(queue_name, vt:, qty:, max_poll_seconds:, poll_interval_ms:)` - With long-polling

  Messages are grouped by the first key in their JSON payload. This ensures fair processing
  when multiple entities (users, orders, etc.) have messages in the queue, preventing any
  single entity from monopolizing workers.
- **[Feature]** Add Topic Routing support (AMQP-like patterns). New methods in `PGMQ::Client`:
  - `bind_topic(pattern, queue_name)` - Bind a topic pattern to a queue
  - `unbind_topic(pattern, queue_name)` - Remove a topic binding
  - `produce_topic(routing_key, message, headers:, delay:)` - Send message via routing key
  - `produce_batch_topic(routing_key, messages, headers:, delay:)` - Batch send via routing key
  - `list_topic_bindings(queue_name:)` - List all topic bindings
  - `test_routing(routing_key)` - Test which queues a routing key matches
  - `validate_routing_key(routing_key)` - Validate a routing key
  - `validate_topic_pattern(pattern)` - Validate a topic pattern

  Topic patterns support wildcards: `*` (single word) and `#` (zero or more words).
  Requires PGMQ v1.11.0+.

### Testing
- **[Feature]** Add Fiber Scheduler integration tests demonstrating compatibility with Ruby's Fiber Scheduler API and the `async` gem for concurrent I/O operations.

### Infrastructure
- **[Fix]** Update docker-compose.yml volume mount for PostgreSQL 18+ compatibility.
- **[Change]** Replace Coditsu with StandardRB for code linting. This provides faster, more consistent linting using the community Ruby Style Guide.

## 0.4.0 (2025-12-26)

### Breaking Changes
- **[Breaking]** Rename `send` to `produce` and `send_batch` to `produce_batch`. This avoids shadowing Ruby's built-in `Object#send` method which caused confusion and required workarounds (e.g., using `__send__`). The new names also align better with the producer/consumer terminology used in message queue systems.

### Queue Management
- [Enhancement] `create`, `create_partitioned`, and `create_unlogged` now return `true` if the queue was newly created, `false` if it already existed. This provides clearer feedback and aligns with the Rust PGMQ client behavior.

### Message Operations
- **[Feature]** Add `headers:` parameter to `produce(queue_name, message, headers:, delay:)` for message metadata (routing, tracing, correlation IDs).
- **[Feature]** Add `headers:` parameter to `produce_batch(queue_name, messages, headers:, delay:)` for batch message metadata.
- **[Feature]** Introduce `pop_batch(queue_name, qty)` for atomic batch pop (read + delete) operations.
- **[Feature]** Introduce `set_vt_batch(queue_name, msg_ids, vt_offset:)` for batch visibility timeout updates.
- **[Feature]** Introduce `set_vt_multi(updates_hash, vt_offset:)` for updating visibility timeouts across multiple queues atomically.

### Notifications
- **[Feature]** Introduce `enable_notify_insert(queue_name, throttle_interval_ms:)` for PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY support.
- **[Feature]** Introduce `disable_notify_insert(queue_name)` to disable notifications.

### Compatibility
- [Enhancement] Add Ruby 4.0.0 support with full CI testing.
